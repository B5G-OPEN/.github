Collection of repositories gathered in the context of the European project: [B5G-Open](https://www.b5g-open.eu/)

## Abstract

B5G-OPEN targets the design, prototyping and demonstration of a novel end-to-end integrated packet-optical transport architecture based on MultiBand (MB) optical transmission and switching networks. MB expands the available capacity of optical fibres, by enabling transmission within S, E, and O bands, in addition to commercial C and/or C+L bands, which translates into a potential 10x capacity increase and low-latency for services beyond 5G.

## Organization rules

- B5G-OPEN members can create new public repositories on their own. When creating one:
  - All repo names should be of the form ``b5gopen_XXXX``, where XXX should be a relatively short, but descriptive name.
  - The new repo created must have a ``README.md`` with a short brief, so any external reader (including the project reviewers) can understand what the repo will contain.
  - New repositories must be notified to the other B5G-OPEN members via email. Please use the WP6 list ([WP6.b5g-open@tid.es](mailto:WP6.b5g-open@tid.es)) for that.
  - The repo creator should update the repo index (the table below in this readme), adding one row to the table, with the project name and a project description (1-3 lines). Please, try to use the same format and style as the other repos you see there. Please note that this change to global ``README.md``, should be sent as a pull request, and the global maintainer will handle it.
  - Repo creators are responsible for managing their own repos in all its aspects.
